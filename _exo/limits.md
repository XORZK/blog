The following is the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $c$:

$$\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to c}}f(x)$$

By "approaches $c$", $x$ reaches a number arbitrarily close to $c$, but is never equal to $c$.

In order of for the limit $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to c}}f(x)$ to exist, $f(x)$ must tend to the same value as $x$ approaches $c$ from both the right and left side: $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to c^{-}}}f(x)$ = $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to c^{+}}f(x)}$.

The function, $f(x)$, is said to become infinite as $x$ approaches $c$ if $f(x)$ can be made arbitrarily large or small by taking $x$ significantly close to $c$:
$\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to c}f(x)} = \infty$ or $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to c}f(x)} = -\infty$.

**For example:** the limit: $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to 0}\dfrac{1}{x}}$ is infinite.

As $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to 0^{-}}\dfrac{1}{x}} = -\infty$ and $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to 0^{+}}\dfrac{1}{x}} = \infty$. This is also the reason you can't divide by 0.

If the function, $f(x)$, can be made arbitrarily fixed as $x \to \pm\infty$, we write:
$\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to \infty}f(x)} = L$ or $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to -\infty}f(x)} = L$ for some $L \in \mathbb{R}$.

## End Behavior of Polynomial Functions

For each polynomial, $P(x)$, such that the degree of $P(x) \geq 1$, approaches $\pm \infty$ as $x \to \pm\infty$. The end behavior of a polynomial acts in accordance to the degree of the polynomial and the sign of the leading coefficient. Let $$n = deg(P(x))$$ and $$a$$ be the leading coefficient.
