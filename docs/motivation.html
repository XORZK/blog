			<h1> A Rant about Motivation </h1>
			<p>I miss who I was over the winter break. Fuck, I miss who I was yesterday. I feel like everyday is just a downwards spiral of motivation and determination. Seriously, what’s the point?</p>

<p>After a certain point, you get high enough grades, and everything feels good, then it quickly disappears as for the rest of the semester you continuously stress yourself out for the rest of the year. I think I understand the average GPA admission for top schools like MIT, Caltech or Yale. A high enough GPA doesn’t really mean shit, other than the fact that you either have enough commitment to keep yourself afloat for months at a time, or you’re really smart.</p>

<p>It’s nearing the end of the semester, and I’m genuinely trying my best to stay afloat, but it’s not working. I just want to be left alone.</p>

<p>My motivation for school is slowly declining, but I know that I’m still going to stress myself out to the limit no matter the circumstance.</p>
