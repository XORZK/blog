			<h1> Limits and Continuity </h1>
			<p>The following is the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $c$:</p>

\[\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to c}}f(x)\]

<p>By “approaches $c$”, $x$ reaches a number arbitrarily close to $c$, but is never equal to $c$.</p>

<p>In order of for the limit $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to c}}f(x)$ to exist, $f(x)$ must tend to the same value as $x$ approaches $c$ from both the right and left side: $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to c^{-}}}f(x)$ = $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to c^{+}}f(x)}$.</p>

<p>The function, $f(x)$, is said to become infinite as $x$ approaches $c$ if $f(x)$ can be made arbitrarily large or small by taking $x$ significantly close to $c$:
$\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to c}f(x)} = \infty$ or $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to c}f(x)} = -\infty$.</p>

<p><strong>For example:</strong> the limit: $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to 0}\dfrac{1}{x}}$ is infinite.</p>

<center>
As $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to 0^{-}}\dfrac{1}{x}} = -\infty$ and $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to 0^{+}}\dfrac{1}{x}} = \infty$. This is also the reason you can't divide by 0.
</center>

<p>If the function, $f(x)$, can be made arbitrarily fixed as $x \to \pm\infty$, we write:
$\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to \infty}f(x)} = L$ or $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to -\infty}f(x)} = L$ for some $L \in \mathbb{R}$.</p>

<h2 id="end-behavior-of-polynomial-functions">End Behavior of Polynomial Functions</h2>

<p>For each polynomial, $P(x)$, such that the degree of $P(x) \geq 1$, approaches $\pm \infty$ as $x \to \pm\infty$. The end behavior of a polynomial acts in accordance to the degree of the polynomial and the sign of the leading coefficient. Let \(n = deg(P(x))\) and \(a\) be the leading coefficient.</p>
