			<h1> Turing Machines </h1>
			<p>Turing machines are a model of computation that manipulates symbols on an infinitely long strip of tape according to a table of rules. Despite the model’s simplicity, it’s been proven to be able to implement any computer algorithm.</p>

<p>The Turing machine has 4 main components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An infinitely long strip of memory, split into cells, which hold a singular symbol from the alphabet of the machine.</li>
  <li>A read/write head which is positioned over one of these cells.</li>
  <li>A state register, which stores the current state of the machine.</li>
  <li>A finite table of instructions:
    <ul>
      <li>This table operates on the current of the state of the machine (\(q_i\)) and the symbol read from the tape (\(a_j\)).</li>
      <li>Using these states, \(q_i\) and \(a_j\), the machine can:
        <ul>
          <li>Erase or write a new symbol to the current cell.</li>
          <li>Move the head one cell to the left or right (denoted as \(L\), \(R\), or \(N\) [neutral]).</li>
          <li>Change states (\(q_i\) becomes \(q_{i_1}\)).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For a system to be denoted as Turing complete, it must be able to simulate a Turing machine, which, by definition, means that it’s theoretically capable of expressing any task definable by an algorithm, ignoring the limitations of finite memory. For example, the card game, “Magic: the Gathering” is Turing complete. Crazy, right?</p>

<h2 id="formal-definition">Formal Definition</h2>

<p>A Turing machine can be formally defined as a 7-tuple \(\langle Q, \Gamma, b, \Sigma, \delta, q_{0}, F\rangle\) where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(Q\) is a finite, non-empty set of states.</li>
  <li>\(\Gamma\) is a finite, non-empty set of alphabet symbols.</li>
  <li>\(b \in \Gamma\) is the blank symbol. At any time, a Turing machine has an infinite amount of \(b\) on the tape.</li>
  <li>\(\Sigma \in \Gamma \setminus \{b\}\) is the set of input symbols.</li>
  <li>\(\delta\) is a partial function known as the transition function. It defines the behavior of the Turing machine given a symbol and state.</li>
  <li>\(q_0 \in Q\) is the initial state.</li>
  <li>\(F \in Q\) is the set of accepting states. If the Turing machine eventually reaches state \(F\), it’s said to have accepted the initial tape contents.</li>
</ul>
