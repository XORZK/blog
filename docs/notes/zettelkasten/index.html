<p>Zettelkasten is a german word that means “slip box” or “card file”. A zettelkasten is a interconnected system of tidbits of information, stored on ___ (left upto the user), where these notes are interconnected primarily by <strong>metadata</strong>. Traditionally, zettelkasten is a knowledge system that uses physical cards/paper (hence, “card file”), although, given the rise of online knowledge bases/note-taking apps, such as Obsidian, Notion, Remnote, and more, online zettelkastens have become progressively more prominent, primarily due to their efficiency.</p>

<h2 id="metadata">Metadata</h2>

<p>Metadata is self-reflective data. Just as how many webpages contain metadata that briefly outlines the webpage (often, in attempts to perform SEO to be one of the search results), when it comes to zettelkasten, metadata revolves primarily about subject headings and tags, so that it may be connected to notes containing similar metadata.</p>

<p>Some important metadata that may be helpful towards categorizing notes may be:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Field:</strong> The field in which the idea lies within (Art, Math, Physics, Computer Science)</li>
  <li><strong>Task at Hand:</strong> The current task/problem that invoked this idea.
    <ul>
      <li>My ideas occur primarily whenever I’m facing certain problems/tasks.</li>
      <li>For example, I’ve recently had a fair share of exposure towards some new applications of matrices when working on graphics for a game ([<strong>TASK</strong>]: GAME DEV, [<strong>FIELD</strong>]: COMPUTER SCIENCE/GRAPHICS)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Date:</strong> The period of time is often irrelevant towards notes. It may be helpful towards outlining the period of time in which someone learnt/thought of something.</li>
  <li><strong>Topics/Tags:</strong> A list of topics discussed in a certain note.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, if I were to write a note about rotation matrices within computer graphics, the metadata would be:</p>

<center>
<p>[<b>DATE</b>]: [2023-01-07]</p>
<p>[<b>FIELD</b>]: [LINEAR ALGEBRA, COMPUTER GRAPHICS] </p>
<p>[<b>TASK</b>]: [ROTATING POINTS AROUND THE ORIGIN USING MATRICES] </p>
<p>[<b>TAGS</b>]: [COMPOUND ANGLE FORMULAS, MATRICES, LINEAR ALGEBRA, GAME DEV]</p>
</center>

<h2 id="blasphemous-beginnings">Blasphemous Beginnings</h2>

<p>I don’t think I have the organizational skills to write separate notes to distribute and store them somewhere in my room. Furthermore, I also don’t enjoy the idea of online zettelkasten as it may deprive the feeling of understanding and completely processing notes. For me, writing notes will always be beneficial in comparison to typing them up, so I’m going to create a zettelkasten within a fresh notebook, seeing how far I can get before it becomes too complex to maintain.</p>

<h2 id="update">Update</h2>

<p>It didn’t work out. I guess I don’t enjoy writing down ideas so rigidly, in a specific location. I think for the couple weeks that I did uphold my promise of a Zettelkasten-like system, I was doing it to feel relatively intelligent.</p>
